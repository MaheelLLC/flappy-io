inputs: bird y, top pipe, bottom pipe
outputs: jump?
activation function (for output layer): tanh
- NEAT will pick activation function for hidden layers.
- tanh allows us to squish the output neuron to between -1 and 1
population size: 100
- how many birds we will have running each generation.
fitness function: how far the bird gets into the level (distance), how many frames it survives
- by far most important piece of the NEAT algorithm
- we don't really have to worry about population size and activation function as much as this.
- we need a way to evaluate how good our birds are.
max generations: 30
- if we don't have a good bird by 30 generations, cut the program.
