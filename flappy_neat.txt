What are neural networks
input layer
- eyes of the ai

inputs for flappy
- bird y
- top pipe
- bottom pipe

output layer
- jump?

To pass input values to output, we use connections and weights.
weight represents how strong or weak the connection should be.

We feed 3 numbers to the AI (bird position, top pipe's bottomost position, and bottom pipe's top most position)
let's say bird position = 500
top pipe relative to bird = 100 pixels above bird
bottom pipe relative to bird = 75 pixels below bird

weighted sum = (500 * -7) + (100 * -2.3) + (75 * 5) + Bias
-7, -2.3, and 5 are weights.

Bias: a number that allows us to tweak our neural network in another way.
- think of it as a y intercept of a graph.
- this will allow us to move our network up or down a little bit to shift it into the right position.

F = activation function

Output = F(weighted sum)
F = TanH
TanH squishes the value in between -1 and 1. Kinda like a normalizing function.
let's say bias = 600

output = F(-3500 + -230 + 375 + 600)
tanh(-2755) = -1 = output
if output > 0.5:
    jump
else:
    don't jump

NEAT
- start with "we don't know anything"
- start off with a random population of 100 birds.
- each bird in the population has a neural network that controls it.
- we test each of these networks and evaluate their fitness (how well they do)
    - fitness = how far the bird progressed in the level, every frame it moves forward without dying = +1 fitness
- we grab the best of this population
- mutate and breed the best of this population to create a new population.
- now continue to repeat the process until we are satisfied with the performance of the birds.
